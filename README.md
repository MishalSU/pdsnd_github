# Bike Share Data Analysis Project

### Date created
September 25, 2024

### Project Title
Exploring U.S. Bike Share Data with Python

### Description
This project analyzes bike share data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, the project computes descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions about bike share usage patterns, including the most common times of travel, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics. An interactive terminal-based script allows users to filter the data by city and time to explore the data dynamically.

### Files used
- **bikeshare.py**: The main Python script that imports, processes, and analyzes the data.
- **chicago.csv**: Dataset for Chicago bike share system.
