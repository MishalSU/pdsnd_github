# Bike Share Data Analysis Project

### Date created
September 25, 2024

### Project Title
Exploring U.S. Bike Share Data with Python

### Description
This project analyzes bike share data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, the project computes descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions about bike share usage patterns, including the most common times of travel, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics. An interactive terminal-based script allows users to filter the data by city and time to explore the data dynamically.

### Files used
- **bikeshare.py**: The main Python script that imports, processes, and analyzes the data.
- **chicago.csv**: Dataset for Chicago bike share system.
- **new_york_city.csv**: Dataset for New York City bike share system.
- **washington.csv**: Dataset for Washington bike share system.

### Installation and Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python 3 and Anaconda**:
   - Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to access Python, NumPy, and pandas.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Open your terminal and install required packages if necessary:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas
     ```

3. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the project repository or download it from your source (e.g., GitHub):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MishalSU/pdsnd_github
     ```
   - Ensure the dataset CSV files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`) are in the project folder.

4. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
     ```bash
     python bikeshare.py
     ```

5. **Follow Interactive Prompts**:
   - The script will guide you through selecting a city and applying time filters for analysis.
